* **App Name**
    Wise Water?
    Hunter Water?
***Love Water***
* **Sell to other providers?**
* **Summary**
    * *We are solving the education and datas issue around water management.*
    * *We are tackling the 60%+ of water used domestically (the + is for the domestic portion of the 10% “lost” for unspecified reasons)*
    * *We touch on multiple tenets*
    * *“Water efficiency: Supporting water that is managed efficiently, delivering maximum environmental and social benefit at least cost”*
    * *“Water performance: Effective measurement and reporting on water security to our community”*
    * *“Water sustainability: Supporting water that is managed within sustainable limits, delivering whole of water cycle outcomes”*
    * *“Water reliability: Supporting water supplies that are secure, resilient and deliver customer value.”*
* **Problems**
    * *Uncertainty in the future water supplies*
        * Modelling predicts the worst droughts we have seen, i.e. the “Millenium Drought” was conservative to the predictive modelling http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/drought/knowledge-centre/previous-droughts.shtml
    * *Poor Data Analytics*
        * Difficulty in measuring and accounting for water losses
        * Difficulty in correlating losses to the problem source
        * Rudimentary and costly data acquisition methods; cameras are installed to monitor sewers to identify losses, manual inspections of dams and sites
    * *Weak Customer Relationship*
        * Water users and water suppliers are not engaged
        * The relationship does not persist
        * No direct connection to their users
    * *Expensive, High-effort Education*
        * Targeted campaigns “Waterwise” and “I Love Water” only occurring in droughts
        * Difficult and slow distribution
        * Environmental cost
        * Education is reactionary, not proactive
* **Solution**  
    * *A domestic app to record water sources within the home*
        * Easy enough for children to use to identify water sources within the household
        * Information on random water facts when a certain type of water component is identified
        * Prediction of crude water usage based on the number of occupants that use that room and the properties of the
    * *A domestic app to understand household water rating*
        * User rating based on usage
        * Personalised suggestions to improve the usage
        * Keeping up with the Jones’s Target vs Actuals
        * Incentives for implementing change e.g. “Save 5L per week for a month for kids free at the movies”
    * *A domestic app to understand wider water issues and engage with water suppliers*
        * Link to your water company
        * Explore how water works with dams, stormwater, treatment, leakage issues etc.
        * Push notifications for water restrictions, local outages
        * Integration with water accounts
        * Raise issues of leaks at individuals house
    * *A retrofit device that provides greater accuracy of water usage*
        * Vibration or temperature sensor that communicates when a tap is turned on or off
    * *Distribution to a cloud API and sensor feed on your device*
        * Data available to water suppliers
        * Data available within the app to users
        * Data available for potential businesses
* **Implementation**
    * *A single solution app available from the App Store or in browser / Progressive Web App (PWA) form including*
        * The education process of water source identification
        * The motivational incentives for reducing domestic water usage
        * An engagement system between water suppliers and water consumers
    * *Promotion through schools for free retrofit devices for children to fit and explore water interactively in their home*
    * *Hunterwise for highschool?*
* **Road Map**
    * *Future-focused integration of smart technologies*
        * Exploration of higher accuracy sensors during the DA approval integration for
    * *Industry-facing Extension*
        * Industrial sensors
        * Commercial analytics for specialised use cases
    * *Water Supplier Exenstion*
        * Water meter sensors (heavily done before, but important to determine the household usage vs. the usage of each tap, to identify that 10%)
        * Extension to water network sensors in dams & catchments
        * Water visualisation
    * *Pivot to energy consumption*
