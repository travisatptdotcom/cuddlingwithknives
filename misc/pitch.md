2- The Love Water solution, to keep with an existing name.

3- Looking at the overall condition of Australia's water gave our team the idea to try and make a difference all over the country.
We're in a drought, we're always in a drought, we'll end up in a drought in no time too.

4- There are very few ways of interacting with water usage and current water statistics around australia.
Is there any proof that we will continue having water with our current demand? 
Aside from setting up water and paying bills, who keeps in contact with their providers?
The education of water is done amidst drought, and is not distributed fast enough, and historically
only having an engagement of ~10-15% such as those on screen.
Water based solutions are usually expensive or ineffective; manual inspections are costly and time consuming.

5- Our team believes lack of education is a major factor, everyone is in an unaware ignorance and 
due to that, they overuse water. This reduces water reserves for critical times and threatens
a complete lack of clean water for everyone.

Telling people to stop using water amidst a drought is pointless; the water is gone, and you can't make it come back.

We aim to teach people before they're in a drought If we save water now
the next dry patch doesn't have to be a big deal, we could even push our excess water to rural australia
and help people with not a drop to their name.

6- We are tackling the 60%+ of water used domestically, and defeating rudimentary methods of 
detecting water losses in a tech oriented way, but still aim to integrate with daily life 
through an app that visualises your real time water usage and develops with your usage habits, learning 
how you use your water on an individual level and providing tailored information to you.

We need to develop great water habits to match the demand of the changing climate, and face
the potential reality of a significant increase of frequent in droughts.

7- Installing sensors partnered with self learning or smart algorithms to develop a relation to an 
individuals water usage will create their ecosystem, similar to most smart home bubbles, yet 
costing a fraction of one.

Sensors remove dated methods of loss detection through intelligent algorithm design pinpointing water loss. 
Most water is lost through leaks, detecting this early can prevent degredation of houses and land, and save
large amounts of water.
sensors on pipes and sewers provide instand access to blockage locations, etc.

Interacting with our app helps to forward information to a water provider to bridge the gap between 
user and provider, as well as provide more routes of education through one commonplace web app.

Our app provides methods to create a more self sustaining water ecosystem wherever you are and incentivises all of this 
through rewards and displays of the good you're doing; Coupons and rewards for proper water use will encourage 
people to further develop healthier water habits. 

Our team has researched examples of such sensors, from water and moisture to temperature and vibration,
any sensor system being on average $10. New and Old developments and buildings can have these installed, 
due to the large variety of sensors that already exist.

Each sensor would work in tandem, the mesh network of different sensors interacting with each other 
and sending data to a centralised open source API, returning real time water use to the individual,
and providing data to council and other business areas opening opportunities for other teams and companies to
work off of said collected data. Open source water useage data is not, or is barely, available.

We propose three such example sensors for the residencies to adapt; Firstly, a tactile touch sensor for 
something such as a toilet flush, to interact and ping the API, waking the rest of the related pipe sensors.
It's commonplace and simple enough that even kids can use it, without changing anything they're already doing.
Continuing from here, a temperature sensor can detect the change in temperature as water is travelling 
through a pipe it is connected to, making sure it is flowing right and using extrapolation with regards to time
to accurately measure the amount of water having been used. 
Finally, vibration sensors attached to pipes can detect the flow rate, and once accustomed, can detect abnormalities.
This is how leaks can be found and dealt with before they become a bigger issue. 

As an example; A household can have tactile tap sensors, reacting on touch to recognise water flow and waking other sensors. 
As water is sent through pipes, a sensor sitting along one recognises water travelling through it from the 
temperature change of the pipe, but a vibration sensor earlier on the pipe might not be detecting enough movement, 
perhaps there is a leak within the pipe reducing water flow.

8- We're proposing something that isn't forced upon people, such as a water "restriction,"
but simply giving the opportunity for people to save money with incentives based off of better water habits, similar
to the Dine and Discover program within Australia, and educate themselves in the process; save 100 litres? Have a 
$100 off your next water bill!

Water restriction rules are told to you, we want people to develop these rules of their own accord,
just with a little bit of a push. 

slide

9- Due to the accessibility of a smart phone app, or progressive web app,
people can easily interact with it. Giving them access to view the water usage around them encourages them 
to perform well, gameifying it even and encouraging kids to frequent the app.
Ease of access to billing and payments through the app is convenient, this and providing options to access
their accounts and other miscellaneous provider hosted services encourages and incentivizes older audiences 
to use our app too.
The ability to contact a myriad of helpful services within our app appeals to those
less technologically inclined or with accessibility difficulties, overall giving everyone options to interact
with our app.

slide

10- I can't tell you every niche little item we had planned for this project. 
To touch on the roadmap we had in mind, and to summarise, we wanted to improve data 
collection on water, maintain customer relations, educate in an effective and consistant way, install cheap 
smart devices to create an accessible data network, create an accessible and convenient progressive web app,
extend to industry with more specialised sensors, invasive sensors on items such as water meters and catchments,
and finally, the pivot to energy consumption partnered with water.

Thanks for your attention, in the rest of the time was there any questions or something of a similar nature?
